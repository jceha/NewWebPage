# Research
## Interests
My research interests lie in cognitive neuroscience and human-computer interaction. By increasing our understanding of cognition I would like to develop innovative, intuitive interfaces. I am particularly interested in brain-computer interfaces and human-robot interaction. The current focus of my Ph.D. is on curiosity and its application to education social robotics.

# Previous Projects
## Psychoacoustic Experiment on Voice Perception
#### Department of Otorhinolaryngology (Audiology), University Medical Centre Groningen
_Speech Perception Lab - Dr. Deniz Baskent (co-supervisor: Dr. Marieke van Vugt)_ 
- Psychoacoustic experiment on voice perception with cochlear implant (CI) and hearing aid simulations. Results show a bimodal hearing benefit which is limited to fundamental frequency perception.

## EEG-based Neurofeedback System (Brain-Computer Interface)
#### Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Groningen
_Belief, Perception, and Cognition Lab - Dr. Jacob Jolij (co-supervisors: Dr. Deniz Baskent & Dr. Marieke van Vugt)_ 
- Developed and pilot tested an electroencephalography (EEG) based neurofeedback system for improving speech perception in CI users. Results indicate a necessity for further research on event-related potentials, specifically the P300 waveform, elicited by non-word, vocoded speech stimuli.

## EEG study on Theta Oscillation Phase-Locking
#### Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering, University of Groningen
_Cognitive Modelling Group - Dr. Marieke van Vugt_ 
- EEG study on theta oscillation phase-locking after attentional blink (AB) training. After training away the AB, no significant increase found in theta oscillation phase-locking.
