# About
In the second year of my Ph.D. in HCI at the University of Waterloo (supervised by with Dr. Edith Law), my research interests lie in cognitive science and human-computer interaction. By increasing our understanding of cognition I would like to develop innovative, intuitive interactions. To this end, my research currently focuses on curiosity-driven teaching and learning and its applications to education.

## Current Projects
#### Curious Robot Peers
School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo _Human-Computer Interaction Lab - Dr. Edith Law_, Inria Bordeaux _FLOWERS Lab - Dr. Pierre-Yves Oudeyer_


#### Co-designing Educational Robots with Teachers
School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo _Human-Computer Interaction Lab - Dr. Edith Law_


#### Neural Correlates of Curiosity
School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo _Human-Computer Interaction Lab - Dr. Edith Law_, Inria Bordeaux _POTIOC - Dr. Fabien Lotte_

## Previous Projects
#### Psychoacoustic Experiment on Voice Perception
Department of Otorhinolaryngology (Audiology), University Medical Centre Groningen,
_Speech Perception Lab - Dr. Deniz Baskent (co-supervisor: Dr. Marieke van Vugt)_ 
- Psychoacoustic experiment on voice perception with cochlear implant (CI) and hearing aid simulations. Results show a bimodal hearing benefit which is limited to fundamental frequency perception.

#### EEG-based Neurofeedback System (Brain-Computer Interface)
Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Groningen,
_Belief, Perception, and Cognition Lab - Dr. Jacob Jolij (co-supervisors: Dr. Deniz Baskent & Dr. Marieke van Vugt)_ 
- Developed and pilot tested an electroencephalography (EEG) based neurofeedback system for improving speech perception in CI users. Results indicate a necessity for further research on event-related potentials, specifically the P300 waveform, elicited by non-word, vocoded speech stimuli.

#### EEG study on Theta Oscillation Phase-Locking
Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering, University of Groningen,
_Cognitive Modelling Group - Dr. Marieke van Vugt_ 
- EEG study on theta oscillation phase-locking after attentional blink (AB) training. After training away the AB, no significant increase found in theta oscillation phase-locking.
