# About
#### Ph.D. Computer Science: Human-Computer Interaction, 
University of Waterloo, Canada (2017-2021)


#### M.Sc. Human-Machine Communication _cum laude_, 
University of Groningen, the Netherlands (2014-2016)
- The program focuses on Cognitive Science and its applications. It provides insights into human cognition and teaches how to use this knowledge in applied settings, such as tutoring systems, speech technology and human-computer interaction.

#### Honours Master ‘High Tech Systems and Materials’, 
University of Groningen, the Netherlands (2014-2016)
- 1.5 year program, organized by UGroningen in cooperation with Philips and other major industry partners, worth 20 ECTS and followed in addition to the standard master’s 

#### B.Sc. Cognitive Systems: Cognition and Brain, 
University of British Columbia, Canada (2009-2014)
- A multi-disciplinary undergraduate program involving four departments: Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology
- The program provides students with a grounding in the principles and techniques used by intelligent systems both natural and artificial.  It emphasizes the study of existing systems (e.g., perception; linguistics), the design of new ones (e.g., machine vision; machine intelligence), and the design of interfaces between different forms of intelligent agents (e.g., human-computer interfaces)


# Research
## Interests
I am working towards my Ph.D. with Dr. Edith Law, at the University of Waterloo. My research interests lie in cognitive science and human-computer interaction. By increasing our understanding of cognition I would like to develop innovative, intuitive interfaces. To this end, my research currently focuses on investigating curiosity-driven teaching and learning and its application to education.

## Previous Projects
#### Psychoacoustic Experiment on Voice Perception
Department of Otorhinolaryngology (Audiology), University Medical Centre Groningen,
_Speech Perception Lab - Dr. Deniz Baskent (co-supervisor: Dr. Marieke van Vugt)_ 
- Psychoacoustic experiment on voice perception with cochlear implant (CI) and hearing aid simulations. Results show a bimodal hearing benefit which is limited to fundamental frequency perception.

#### EEG-based Neurofeedback System (Brain-Computer Interface)
Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Groningen,
_Belief, Perception, and Cognition Lab - Dr. Jacob Jolij (co-supervisors: Dr. Deniz Baskent & Dr. Marieke van Vugt)_ 
- Developed and pilot tested an electroencephalography (EEG) based neurofeedback system for improving speech perception in CI users. Results indicate a necessity for further research on event-related potentials, specifically the P300 waveform, elicited by non-word, vocoded speech stimuli.

#### EEG study on Theta Oscillation Phase-Locking
Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering, University of Groningen,
_Cognitive Modelling Group - Dr. Marieke van Vugt_ 
- EEG study on theta oscillation phase-locking after attentional blink (AB) training. After training away the AB, no significant increase found in theta oscillation phase-locking.
